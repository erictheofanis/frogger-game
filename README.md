FROGGER GAME

Frogger is a game experience where the user controls the player -- who has to avoid the enemy obstacles on the path in order to reach the water. When they player reaches the water - they win. 

Players use the arrow keys - up, down, left, and right to move the player from the bottom of the board to the the top of the board avoiding the enemy bugs. If the player runs into a bug, he is reset to the bottom of the board to start again. 

The engine and resources JS have been by Udacity and, in large, provide the game engine and resources to run the game. The app.js file updates all of the player and enemy objects.
